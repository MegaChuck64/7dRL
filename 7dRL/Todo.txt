//research invisible obstacle bug. collision and site react to invisible obstacles sometimes. Might be a z index issue
//damage over time, attack rate
//create affect base class
//make enemies hit by fire revealed



//Event/Time
This needs to be sorted out
We should use an event queue
and the daycycle sends tick events to it
then should be able to adjust timescale while in play mode
FTL style
60fps
timescale = ticksPerSecond = 1f = tick every second
//does this mean we do all of the events in the queue
// or do we do 1 event per tick??


// SPELLS
right now spell class is really an AOA, break out spell, 
so base spell has aim path (all spells should have an aim path?)
this spell will then spawn objects that will apply effects to targets
one of those effects could be an AOA that is in a shape

//spells how they should be

heal spell
	holding space, shows a sprite that represents the heal range
	pressing mouse left button, casts the spell, healing anyone in the range


fire ball spell
	holding space, shows a sprite showing the direction the fireball will travel
	press mouse left button, casts the spell, creates a fireball object that travels until it hits something or duration
	//if it hits a character, it applies an affect

	
fire wall spell
	holding space, shows a path of fireball sprites that are low opactiy
	pressing space spawns a bunch of stationary firebals that have a duration
	if collides with cahracter applies a fire effect


aiming
cast
